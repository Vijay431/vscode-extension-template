# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

This is a TypeScript VS Code extension. Source code lives in `src/`: command handlers in `src/commands/`, services in `src/services/`, dependency injection in `src/di/`, managers in `src/managers/`, shared types in `src/types/`, and helpers in `src/utils/`. Unit tests are in `test/unit/`, integration tests in `test/suite/`, mocks in `test/__mocks__/`, and fixtures in `test/fixtures/`. Documentation and site pages are under `docs/` and `site/`. Do not edit generated output in `dist/` or `out-test/`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `pnpm install`: install dependencies.
- `pnpm run build`: bundle the extension with esbuild.
- `pnpm run watch`: rebuild during extension development.
- `pnpm run lint`: run ESLint against `src/`.
- `pnpm run lint:fix`: apply automatic ESLint fixes.
- `pnpm run format`: format the repository with Prettier.
- `pnpm run test:unit`: run Vitest unit tests.
- `pnpm run test:integration`: compile tests and run VS Code integration tests.
- `pnpm run package`: create a `.vsix` package.

Use Node.js 20+ and pnpm. For manual testing, open the repo in VS Code and press `F5`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Write TypeScript and keep modules focused by responsibility. Use PascalCase for classes and service files such as `MyFeatureService.ts`, camelCase for functions and variables, and command names matching package command IDs. Prettier handles formatting; ESLint enforces quality and security rules. Avoid committing compiled `.js` or `.js.map` files under `src/`, `test/`, or `scripts/`.

## Testing Guidelines

Add unit tests in `test/unit/*.test.ts` for services, utilities, and validators. Add integration tests in `test/suite/*.test.ts` when changes touch VS Code commands, context menus, file operations, or editor interactions. Use `test/fixtures/` when possible. Run integration tests before user-facing behavior changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Use Conventional Commits, for example `feat(hello): add greeting command`, `fix(config): respect disabled state`, or `test(unit): cover config validator`. Hooks and CI enforce a maximum of 15 files and 600 changed lines per commit. Branch from `main` using prefixes such as `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, or `refactor/`.

Pull requests should include a clear description, linked issues when applicable, and screenshots or recordings for visible VS Code UI changes. Before opening a PR, run `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run build`, and relevant tests.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Do not commit secrets, local VS Code state, generated packages, or build artifacts. Review `SECURITY.md` for vulnerability reporting. Configuration changes should update `package.json`, related types in `src/types/`, and tests together.
